Image Editing Application

Overview

Image Editing App is a web-based application that allows users to perform various image editing functions, including adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and applying filters. This application is designed to maintain the pixel quality of images, ensuring sharp and clear edits.

This project was created using JavaScript and showcases various image manipulation techniques. It was developed as a challenge to improve my JavaScript skills and learn how to apply them effectively in a real-world application.
